# University Management Application

## Introduction
The **University Management Application** is a Core Java-based project designed to simulate and manage the operations of a university. The project focuses on practical implementation of core Java concepts like file handling, collections, and object manipulation to provide functionality for managing students, faculty, departments, and courses.

The primary goal of this project is to solidify a fundamental understanding of how Java works, especially through hands-on experience with objects and their interactions. It has been an excellent learning experience, helping to understand how things work at a granular level and enhancing problem-solving skills.

## Features
- **Department Management**:
  - Add new departments to the university.
  - View details of existing departments.

- **Student Management**:
  - Add students and associate them with specific departments.
  - Enroll students in courses and manage their attendance and grades.

- **Faculty Management**:
  - Manage faculty credentials with an authentication system.
  - Assign grades and attendance to students.

- **Course Management**:
  - Create and manage courses under specific departments.

- **Authentication System**:
  - Basic login and account creation for administrators and faculty members using file handling.

## Objectives
The project was developed to achieve the following:
1. **Strengthen Core Java Skills**:
   - Practice and explore object creation and usage.
   - Learn file handling techniques for data storage and retrieval.
   - Master working with collections like `List` and `Map`.

2. **Problem-Solving Through Objects**:
   - Use objects to model and manage real-world entities like students, courses, and faculty.
   - Explore how objects interact with each other in a larger system.

3. **Hands-On Learning**:
   - Gain experience with writing, debugging, and running Java programs.
   - Learn the importance of modular code and well-defined classes.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Core Concepts Used**:
  - Object Manipulation (Classes and Objects)
  - File Handling (`FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`)
  - Collections (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`)
  - Basic Authentication Logic
- **Development Environment**: Compatible with any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).

## Key Learnings
1. How to design and implement real-world objects in Java.
2. Effective use of collections for managing groups of data.
3. File handling techniques for persistent storage of user credentials and other information.
4. Designing a simple authentication system using files.
5. Debugging and improving modularity and readability of Java code.
